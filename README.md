## Being a good engineer
Everyone should have the goal to keep the structure in order. For the project to be successfull everyone must collaborate effectively.
Every commit should be a Pull Request (PR) which will then be merged into the main branch by the Team Leader more at (https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

Additionally we will use conventional commits to keep the structure of the whole system and keep track of commits. Please follow the conventional commits guide at (https://www.develer.com/en/blog/git-how-to-write-commits-and-why/). Examples can be found (https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) and (https://github.com/angular/angular/commits/main/) 

Every commit that is not in line with the guidelines of the project will not be accepted.
